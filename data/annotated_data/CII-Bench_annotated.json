By depicting a chimpanzee examining a human foot, the artist may be prompting viewers to consider how humans view themselves in relation to other species. The chimp’s curious interaction with the foot could symbolize a broader inquiry into the nature of humanity—whether we are fundamentally different from other animals or share more similarities than we acknowledge. Additionally, the scattered rocks and broken shell might hint at the idea of tool use and the evolution of intelligence, suggesting that the line between human and animal capabilities is not as clear-cut as we might think.

The bottom text suggests reducing the weight of students' backpacks. The date at the bottom right indicates the image was created in September 1997.\n\n**",
    "implicit_meaning": "**  \nThe image satirizes the heavy academic burden placed on students, using the exaggerated size of the backpacks and the students' strained postures to highlight the issue. The roller skates add a layer of irony, as they imply a sense of urgency or speed in the students' lives, further emphasizing their overloaded schedules. The complaints listed in the text reinforce the message that the education system is putting undue pressure on children, affecting their health and well-being. The suggestion to reduce the weight of backpacks serves as a call for reform in the educational practices to alleviate the students' burdens.",
    "external_knowledge": "**  \n**Cultural Reference:** In many educational systems, particularly in East Asia, students often carry heavy backpacks filled with textbooks, workbooks, and other study materials due to rigorous academic demands. This has become a symbol of the intense pressure and stress placed on young students.  \n**Common Sense:** Excessive weight in backpacks can lead to physical strain, such as back pain and posture issues, especially in growing children. Glasses are commonly associated with nearsightedness, which can be exacerbated by prolonged reading and studying.  \n\n**",

Each chimp is performing one of the classic \"see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\" gestures: the first covers its eyes, the second covers its ears, and the third covers its mouth. They are set against a clear blue sky background.\n\n**",
    "implicit_meaning": "**  \nThe image satirizes the tendency of people in positions of authority or influence—represented here by the formal business attire—to turn a blind eye, deaf ear, and mute voice to issues that require their attention. By dressing the monkeys in business suits, the image suggests that corporate or bureaucratic entities may adopt a willful ignorance to avoid accountability or confrontation with uncomfortable truths. The clear blue sky backdrop could imply a false sense of serenity or normalcy maintained through such deliberate ignorance. Thus, the image critiques the complicity of those who choose not to see, hear, or speak about wrongdoing.",
    "external_knowledge": "**  \nSymbolism: The \"three wise monkeys\" concept is a well-known symbol originating from Japanese folklore. It represents the idea of avoiding involvement in evil by not seeing, hearing, or speaking about it.  \nCultural Reference: In modern contexts, this symbol is often used ironically to criticize individuals or groups who ignore or refuse to acknowledge problems, injustices, or unethical behavior, especially when they have a responsibility to act.\n\n**",

    "implicit_meaning": "**  \nThe image satirizes the hypocrisy of corruption. The character, who appears to be a corrupt official based on his attire and the symbolic gold coins, is laughing at the news of another corruption scandal in the U.S. This suggests a critique of how corruption is widespread and often goes unnoticed or unaddressed within one's own system, leading to a mocking attitude towards others facing similar issues. The humor in the image serves to highlight the absurdity and universality of corruption across different cultures and nations.",

These officials are sometimes portrayed as corrupt or incompetent in Chinese culture.  \n**Symbolism:** The gold coins hanging from the official's hat symbolize wealth and corruption, suggesting that the character is involved in bribery or illicit financial dealings.  \n**Historical Fact:** The reference to the U.S. uncovering a corruption case involving a significant bribe implies a commentary on international perceptions of corruption.  \n\n**",
